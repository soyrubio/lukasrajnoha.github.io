The app can be run be creating a Live Server in this directory.
This can easily be done using VSCode and a Live Server plugin:
Download the Live Server plugin
Open this directory in VSCode
Start the live server
The website should open in your default browser (or manually open the Live Server's port on localhost in your browser)
